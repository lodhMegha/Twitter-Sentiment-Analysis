Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization

# Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.

We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the tweets. 
This is one of the most interesting challenges in NLP.

# Understand the Problem Statement
Let’s go through the problem statement once as it is very crucial to understand the objective before working on the dataset. The problem statement is as follows:

The objective of this task is to detect overall sentiment in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet is positive or negative. Also it tells about the various emotions involved in the tweet.

# Tweets Preprocessing and Cleaning
You are searching for a document in this office space. In which scenario are you more likely to find the document easily? Of course, in the less cluttered one because each item is kept in its proper place. The data cleaning exercise is quite similar. If the data is arranged in a structured format then it becomes easier to find the right information.

The preprocessing of the text data is an essential step as it makes the raw text ready for mining, i.e., it becomes easier to extract information from the text and apply machine learning algorithms to it. If we skip this step then there is a higher chance that you are working with noisy and inconsistent data. The objective of this step is to clean noise those are less relevant to find the sentiment of tweets such as punctuation, special characters, stop words, numbers, and terms which don’t carry much weightage in context to the text.

# Story Generation and Visualization from Tweets
In this section, we will explore the cleaned tweets text. Exploring and visualizing data, no matter whether its text or any other data, is an essential step in gaining insights. 

# Before we begin exploration, we must think and ask questions related to the data in hand. A few probable questions are as follows:

What are the most common words in the entire dataset? What are the most common words in the dataset for negative and positive tweets, respectively? How many hashtags are there in a tweet? Which trends are associated with my dataset? Which trends are associated with either of the sentiments? Are they compatible with the sentiments?
